HAMMERKIND REMAKE

History:
A project I originally started so that I was at least doing something productive while not paying attention in class during high-school. 
I graduated high-school, and I lost motivation to work on the project because I wasn't bored all the time.
Then, about a year passed, I dropped out of college because I wasn't cut out for online college, and in-person college wasn't an option (because of COVID.)
and I started a nine-month online software engineering bootcamp.
I suddenly had something to slack-off from again, so I picked the project back up.
And here we are.

Synopsis:
HAMMERKIND was originally a fangame posted on the MSPaintAdventures Forums in 2011 by CloudCoverGames (AKA Stephen Maxwell). 
It adapts the 2d-sprite based antics of John scurrying around fighting imps while ascending to the first gate featured in Homestuck's second and third acts into a heavily physics-based 2D platformer.
The main draw of the game is how the movement and combat feel as if you took all those little gifs of John frantically jumping around and somehow magically made them playable.
It has the same satisfying weighty-but-agile feel of Andrew Hussie's early-Homestuck animation, but in video-game form.
The goal of this remake is to take that same concept, preserve the main appeal of the Homestuck-come-to-life movement, and expand the scope to cover more of those early video-game-y parts of the comic.

Planned Features:

I currently plan to release the game in two phases.
A demo which will mostly stay true to the structure of the original hammerkind, and a full-release which will basically be a completely original game.

The demo is planned to include:
- Basic Movement and combat like the original.
- Gate-based progression exactly as in the original.
- Save System.
- Automatic House-building slightly expanded from the original.
- Completely Overhauled Manual House-Building (Sburb Server Software, Basically.)
- Sylladex and Expanded Physics-Based Item Mechanic.
- Strife Specibus and Weapon-Type system (depending on the type of weapon, you might have an entirely different control-scheme and player physics.)
- 'Blunt' Weapon-Type (Controls like the original game. Includes light/medium hammers and other misc blunt weapons.)
- 'Heavy' Weapon-Type (Controls akin to Getting Over It, except you also can still walk and jump. You use the mouse to influence your weapon's swing. Includes heavy hammers like the sledgehammer.)
- Overhauled Alchemy system and grist types.
- Echeladder and Stat System.
- Slightly More Underling Types
- (Optional Goal) Local Multiplayer where P1 controls John in the role of the client player and P2 takes the role of Rose as the server player using the mouse, like in the original game.
- (Even Optionaler Goal) Local Multiplayer where any number of players control any amount of Johns (each John that isn't player 1 has a different Consonant as the first letter of their name, ex: Bohn Egbert, Kohn Egbert, Lohn Egbert. The lore is that they're John's definitely real and canon cousins.)
- (REALLY FUCKING Optional Goal) Online Multiplayer where there can be any number of Johns AND Roses. They all work off of the same grist cache. Chaos Ensues.

The full-release is planned to include:
- The demo's campaign included as a separate "Classic Mode"
- Overhauled Gate mechanic, making them function like they do in the comic (Progress through the game by daisy-chaining through the gates, which will take you to distinct locations.)
- Lands and Land Quests
- "Seamless" world locations. (Every location can be hypothetically accessed by physically moving there, I.E. If you were fall below john's house without dying, his land would load in. If you were to fly up far enough, you would be taken to space, where you can then move to other planets.)
- Perspective switch mechanic between John, Rose, Dave, and Jade, each with their own separate house and Land
- 'Slashing' Weapon-Type (Controls akin to the fangame Dave: Accelerate, but in 2D. Includes medium-long blades, or anything that you would make a slashing movement with, really.)
- 'Piercing' Weapon-Type (Controls like a middle-ground between Slashing and Blunt. Includes things like non-magic knitting needles, and small blades like knives and daggers and such.
- 'Shooting' Weapon-Type (Movement Physics are like Slashing, but you attack by aiming and shooting with the mouse, and shooting has physics-based recoil. May require ammo. Includes things like guns and magic wands.)
- Expanded Sburb mechanics
- Probably some other stuff I don't remember right now.
